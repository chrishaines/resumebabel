    Relevant excerpt:

        Your resume is going to go through a bunch of automated transformation
        tools and will be mangled horribly along the way. Any non-ASCII
        character, such as those nonstandard Microsoft Word bullets, or any
        accented character, or (heaven help you) Unicode will be turned into
        our old favorite, the question-mark character ("?").

        You don't want your resume to look like this:

          Resum? for Bob?T???Moblin
          ?Experience
            1997?Present?  Vice?F???**??didn?t?do?sh???for?ten?yea???

        So write it in plain text. Yes. Text. You know. Like from a typewriter,
        or Windows Notepad. ABCs, not PDF.

        Don't expect any whitespace to make it through except newlines and
        single spaces. And don't assume your resume will be viewed in a
        fixed-width font. If you make a nice pretty formatted table using tab
        characters, it will look like ascii-art smoke signals by the time a
        human being looks at it.

        The maximum amount of ASCII art you can get away with, and even this
        is stretching it, is hyphenated lines and bullets. For instance, this
        might be OK:

        Education
        ---------
          * B.S. Computer Science, University of Wherever, 1997
          * M.S. Resume Writing, 2003
            – graduated .357 magnum

        But I wouldn't overdo it.

        If your name has accent characters in it, your best bet is to change
        your name. For instance, if your name is Pièrre l'Éléphant, think
        about whether you'd prefer to have it seen as "Pi?rre l'?l?phant" or
        "Pierre l'Elephant". Sure, your accented characters might make it
        through, but I'd play it safe.

        HTML formatting usually makes it through safely because it's plain
        text. However, even if your tags are left alone by the automated
        mangler, there's no guarantee that your resume will be viewed from
        a browser, and nobody wants to read through a bunch of ugly markup
        while they're trying to assess your skills. So you shouldn't use HTML
        either.

        Text! All the best resumes are plain text. Use text.
