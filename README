One of the most tedious parts of applying to jobs is the resume. Everyone 
accepts a different resume format - HTML, PDF, plain text, MS Word - and it's
a mess.

LinkedIn (and other career websites where you can post a resume) don't 
really help; HR still wants you to paste a plain-text resume into their little
online job application.

This project is a series of scripts to convert a resume to any number of
output formats. JSON is the input, and each module will output to a different
format.

If there is a format you want to see, feel free to write a template and make
a pull request!
