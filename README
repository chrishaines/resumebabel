This project is a series of scripts to convert a resume to any number of
output formats. JSON is the input, and each module will output to a different
format.

One of the most tedious parts of applying to jobs is the resume. Everyone's
HR department accepts a different resume format.

LinkedIn (and other career websites) don't really help; HR still wants you 
to paste a plain-text resume into their little online job application.

If there is a format you want to see, feel free to write a template and make
a pull request!

   * HTML with hResume (in progress)
